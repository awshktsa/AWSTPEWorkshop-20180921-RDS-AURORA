Step 1:
* Switch Region on the AWS console, a drag down menu near right-up corner.
Pick one region close to you.

Step 2: Create a Aurora DB (Serverless)
* **AWS Console > Services > RDS > Create Database > Select Enging > Amazon Aurora**

- We go through latest type "Serverless" for our workshop first

- We go through latest type "Serverless" for our workshop first, and setup the *identifer*, *DB user*, and *DB Password*.

![AWS Workshop Series - inputdbuserpassword](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juntinyeh/AWSWorkshop-20180921-RDS-AURORA/master/images/inputdbuserpassword.png)

- Next step, we need to setup the *Resource Allocation* for your Aurora Serverless.

- Select the *Parameter Group* for your database instance.

- Select DB *VPC* and *Subnet Group* for network setting.

Step 3:
* Check if you already have a EC2 Key pair in your selected region. 
* If not, create one through **AWS Console > EC2 > Key Pairs > Create Key Pair**. 
* Remember to download the private key(.pem) and well saved. 
* In usual, we will move it into ~/.ssh/ sub-folder in your home directory.
* To make it secure, remeber to change the privilege with command 
``` chmod 0400 XXXXX.pem ```

* If you are windows user, and you should download putty.exe and puttygen.exe from [Here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html). And also check the document [Here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen) if you don't know how to convert .pem to .ppk

Step 4:
* Launch a new EC2 instance to operate your database in VPC
- **AWS Console > Services > EC2 > Launch Instance **
- Select Amazon Linux 2 with *Free tier eligible* label, with proper instance type (ex: t2.micro / t3.micro)
- Locate this instance in the same VPC, with public IP attached and SSH security group granted.
- set the userdata with following content

```
#!/bin/sh
yum install mysql
```

- Connect to your EC2, and run the following command to test your database is alive.
```
> mysql -h YOUR-AURORA-ENDPOINT -u YOUR-AURORA-USER -p
```

Step 5:
* Practice how to take a DB Snapshot and restore to a new instance/cluster
- **AWS Console > Services > RDS > Cluster**
- Select Correct DB which you created in Step2 > Actions > Take snapshot
- Give a name to this snap shot

Step 6:
Restore a snapshot to a new Instance
- **AWS Console > Services > RDS > Snapshots**
- Select Correct Snapshot you created in Step5 > Actions > Restore Snapshot
- Pick *Provisioned* this time, and enable the **Back Track**

Step 7:
Create a new RDS-MySQL Cluster with Multi-AZ setting
- **AWS Console > Services > RDS > Instances**
- Create Instance > Select DB Engine as MySQL
- Pick **Dev/Test - MySQL**, and go next step
- Click **Multi-AZ** and set the identifer, account and password.

Step 8:
- Check ReadReplica and Failover feature on your RDS instance

==
Workshop Challenge:
Try to Create a Aurora Replica from MySQL-Cluster
- **AWS Console > Services > RDS > Parameter Group > Create Parameter Group** 

![AWS Workshop Series - parametergroup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juntinyeh/AWSWorkshop-20180921-RDS-AURORA/master/images/parametergroup.png)

- Give a proper name, and select correct group family. 
- Click your parameter group > Edit Parameter
- Setup the *binlog_format* anything but `OFF`
- Create a mysql-slave on your EC2, set the master as your RDS server.

- Refer to (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Procedural.Importing.External.Repl.html) and setup a master-master pair.
